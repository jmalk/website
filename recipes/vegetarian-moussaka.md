## Method

In this method I've interleaved steps for all three components. There are a few early bits of prep where you do something then have to leave it alone for 20 minutes or more, so to me it makes sense to start these off then move to another component of the dish.

1. Boil the new potatoes until tender. When they're done, drain and leave to cool in a bowl.
1. Lay the aubergine out on trays and generously salt it. Set it aside for at least 20 minutes then pat dry with kitchen paper.
1. Start the bechamel by infusing the milk: Add the milk, onion, cloves, and bay leaf to a pan. Gently bring to a boil, then remove from the heat and leave for at least 20 minutes.
1. Pre-heat the oven to 190 fan.
1. Heat 1 tbsp of olive oil in a pan and fry the chopped onion and garlic.
1. Once they've softened, add the pack of lentils, tomatoes, stock, oregano, nutmeg and cinnamon. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then leave to simmer.
1. Give the aubergine and courgette slices a thin coating of olive oil. Bake them for about 20 minutes until soft and tasty. Sprinkle with finely chopped fresh rosemary.
1. Continue the bechamel: Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in the plain flour to form a roux. Cook it for a few minutes.
1. Remove the solids from the infused milk and slowly add it to the roux. Cook the resulting sauce for about 10 minutes to thicken, and season it.
1. Assemble the moussaka in a large casserole dish. It goes: lentil sauce, veg, potatoes, lentil sauce, veg, potatoes, bechamel.
1. Bake for about 50 minutes until the top is nicely browned.
1. Leave to cool for at least 10 minutes, then serve.
