# Pak Choi and Potato Soup

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 10 g butter
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, chopped
- 3 carrots, peeled and grated
- 300 g new potatoes, peeled and cubed
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp mixed herbs
- ½ tsp paprika
- 750 ml veg stock
- 1 pak choi, thinly sliced
- crusty bread and butter, to serve
- crème fraîche, to serve (optional)

## Method

1. Fry the **onion** in the **butter** and **olive oil** until soft.
2. Add the **garlic**, **carrots** and **new potatoes** and fry for about 5 minutes longer.
3. Stir in the **thyme**, **mixed herbs**, **paprika** and season to taste with **salt** and **black pepper**.
4. Pour in the **veg stock**, bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for about 10 minutes until the potatoes have thoroughly softened.
5. Take the soup off the heat and blend it with a hand blender.
6. Put the pan back on the heat, and stir in the **pak choi**. Cook it like this for a few minutes to wilt the pak choi a little.
7. Serve with a dollop of crème fraîche on top, and some bread and butter.

## Notes

For the veg stock, 2 cubes of Kallo in 750 ml of water gave a good result.
