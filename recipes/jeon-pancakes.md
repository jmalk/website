# Jeon

Makes about six chonky pancakes

## Ingredients

### Pancakes

- 3 hash browns, thawed
- 1 carrot, coarsely grated
- 1 red pepper, finely sliced
- 1 small courgette, grated or sliced
- 1 bunch spring onions, cut into inch-long pieces (save a couple for sauce if making)
- 2 cups plain flour
- 1 ½ cups water
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp salt
- Pepper to taste
- Oil for frying

### Dipping Sauce

- 4 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar (or cider, white wine maybe?)
- ½ tsp sugar (if not using sweet soy)
- 1 or 2 spring onions, finely sliced
- Pinch chilli flakes
- 1 clove garlic, very finely chopped
- Sesame seeds

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to keep cooked pancakes warm.
1. Mush the hash browns up with your fingers, and put in a large mixing bowl.
1. Prep all the veg and add it to the bowl.
1. Sprinkle the flour over the veg. Stir it all together. Pour over the water and stir it some more. Make a little well, crack the egg in and beat it. Season with the salt and pepper. Stir some more.
1. One (slightly stingy) cup of mixture makes a decent sized pancake. Mush it into a flat layer on a pan at medium heat and fry for about 5 minutes on a side until well browned.
1. Mix all the dipping sauce ingredients in a bowl and serve!
