# Butternut Squash and Sage Pasta

Serves 4.

## Ingredients

- 400 g butternut squash
- ¼ cup olive oil
- 1 onion, chopped
- 4 cloves garlic, chopped
- 5 sage leaves, chopped
- ½ tbsp thyme, chopped
- 30 g plain flour
- 1 can low-fat coconut milk
- salt and pepper
- ¼ nutmeg, grated
- 250 ml vegetable stock
- ½ tbsp yellow miso paste
- ¼ cup nutritional yeast
- 300 g rigatoni
- vegan parmesan, to serve (optional)
- fresh parsley, chopped, to serve (optional)

## Pans

- A roasting tin or dish for the butternut squash.
- A large non-stick pan, deep enough to use a hand blender in without splashing your kitchen.
- A saucepan for boiling pasta.

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180C (fan).
1. Peel, core and chop the **butternut squash** into small pieces. Roast in a small amount of neutral oil for about 45 minutes, until soft enough that you could mash it easily.
1. Fry the **onion** in the **olive oil** for about five minutes.
1. Add **garlic**, **sage** and **thyme**. Fry for two more minutes.
1. Add the **flour** to the pan and stir quickly. This should form a roux.
1. Gradually add the **coconut milk**, stirring to dissolve the roux into a sauce. Cook it for a few minutes to thicken.
1. Add the roast **butternut squash**, **vegetable stock**, **miso paste** and **nutritional yeast** to the pan. Season with some **salt** and **pepper**, stir it all together, and simmer for a few minutes.
1. Take the pan off the heat completely. Use a hand blender to thoroughly blend the sauce.
1. Cook the **pasta**, then stir it into the sauce.
1. Serve with **parmesan**, fresh **black pepper**, and maybe a herb garnish like chopped **fresh parsley**.

## Notes

It's sweet, rich and creamy, so next time I'd like to try adding some red chilli flakes to cut through that.

The recipe makes plenty of sauce, so some crusty or garlic bread might go nicely with it.
