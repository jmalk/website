# Copy a request from dev tools as a call to fetch

Today I learned that you can copy requests from the Network tab in Chrome dev tools.

When you right-click on a request, you can select Copy, and then it gives you options as to what form you'd like to copy it in. One of the options is `fetch`. This puts the JavaScript code on your clipboard. You can paste the code right back into the dev tools console and run it to repeat the request. Neat!
