## Saleor Attributes

[https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/attributes]()

Products, ProductVariants, and Pages can all have attributes.

The type of an attribute determines what kind of UI a content editor is going to be presented with when editing the product or page. e.g. a `DROPDOWN` type means they'll get a shortlist of options and have to pick one.

## Saleor Variants

[https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/dashboard/catalog/products#product-variants]()

Variants are different versions of a product. But Attributes are shared across Variants. So for example, we might sell a small, medium and large bottle of Olive Branch shower gel. But they're all red.

Variants have attributes to distinguish them. In the example above I guess that might mean an attribute like "weight"?
