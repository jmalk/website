- Passive levelling up is fine but can be better with deliberate levelling up
- Passive levelling up proves you can learn new things, so don't fret about it!

How to do "Active" Levelling Up

1. Develop a specific vision

"I want to do machine learning" is too general.

Tangent: Digging holes - going down a rabbit hole of looking up things you don't know, which lead to more things you don't know...

"Mood Metrics" - feeling good? You're making great progress! Feeling bad? You're terrible at this...

What worked better for her? Practise projects. Force you to ask yourself what you're trying to accomplish with the skill set you're trying to develop.

Practise projects still allow for some digging, but they keep you focussed on achieving stuff that would be useful to real-world applications.

2. Rely on discipline (not motivation)

Secret to maintaining motivation? Don't!

Rely on routine. Have a recurring schedule of when you do your practise.

Have special contingency plans for days when you don't feel like it. Special coffee, a t-shirt that says "because I said I would" etc. Then get on with the practise even if it's not the best you've ever done.

Keep a calendar or journal:

Look forward to the sense of accomplishment of putting a star in your calendar for doing a thing.

Look back on the stars with pride.

When you *feel* like you're not making progress, look at the calendar and remember what you can do now that you couldn't then.

3. Start with questions

e.g. "How did we go from information transfer over the internet to http specifically? There was a big gap in time between those two milestones."

Ask for help! We do a lot alone, but we don't have to.

4. Take care of each other

"Commit tracing" - copy commits that are intersting to you. Depends on other devs having done good atomic commits with clear messages. So when you're making commits imagine someone in the future using it as an example.

Blogging. Posts that focus on how to solve a very specific, difficult problem, have been some of her most popular.
